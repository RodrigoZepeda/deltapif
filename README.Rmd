Calculate both **Potential Impact Fractions (PIF)** and **Population Attributable Fractions (PAF)**
for aggregated data and their confidence intervals using the delta method. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of deltapif with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("RodrigoZepeda/deltapif")
```

## Calculating a population attributable fraction

To estimate a population attributable fraction two
ingredients are required:

- `beta`: the relative risk or a value from which to calculate the relative risk (with variance `var_beta`).
- `p`: the exposure prevalence (with variance `var_p`).

and in the case of potential impact fractions we also require:

- `p_cft`: the counterfactual prevalence.  

> **Note** An important hypothesis of the current method is that
the relative risk estimate and the prevalence of exposure are both independent
in the sense that they were estimated in different populations and studies. 

For example [Lee et al](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.19672) estimate
the attributable fraction of smoking on dementia. For that purpose they report 
the following:

-  A relative risk of `1.59 (1.15, 2.20)`
-  An exposure prevalence of `8.5`

We can calculate a point estimate of the PAF as follows:

```{r lee_example}
library(deltapif)
paf(p = 0.085, beta = 1.59, quiet = TRUE)
```

Note that this follows the formula by [Levin](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloepi.2021.100062):

$$
\textrm{PAF} = \frac{p \cdot (\text{RR} - 1)}{1 + p \cdot (\text{RR} - 1)}
$$

Additional examples show how to calculate the PAF for multiple categories. 

### Adding uncertainty

Note that there is no uncertainty in the fraction as we have not inputed the
standard deviation of the relative risk. To do so we notice that the variance for
the relative risk is actually for the log of the relative risk. We follow the formula
from [Cochrane's handbook](https://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_7/7_7_3_2_obtaining_standard_deviations_from_standard_errors_and.htm):

$$
\text{variance}_{\ln(\text{RR})} = \Bigg(\frac{\ln(\text{upper limit}) - \ln(\text{lower limit})}{2\times 1.95}\Bigg)^2
$$

```{r}
((log(2.20) - log(1.15)) / (2*1.95))^2
```

And because the uncertainty was specified for the log of the relative risk we use
the natural logarithm `ln` of `1.59` as our `beta` where `log(1.59) = 0.4637` and specify that
the way to get our relative risk is through the exponential (`exp`) function. 
Finally as no uncertainty was given for `p` we set `var_p = 0`. 

```{r lee_example_with_uncertainty}
paf(p = 0.085, beta = 0.4637, var_beta = 0.02766639, var_p = 0, rr_link = exp)
```

## Calculating a potential impact fraction

The paper also considers the potential impact fraction of a 15% reduction of smoking
this can be achieved with the `pif` function by specifying the counterfactual distribution
(in this case the 15% reduction results in  $0.085 \times (1 - 0.15) = 0.07225$)

```{r lee_example_pif}
pif(p = 0.085, p_cft = 0.07225, beta = 0.4637, var_beta = 0.02766639, var_p = 0, rr_link = exp)
```

Note that both the PIF and PAF result in similar point estimates and CIs as in _Lee et al_ 
who report:

- **PAF**: 4.9 (1.3-9.3)
- **PIF**: 0.7 (0.2-1.4)
